This is one of a collection of interface libraries that can be used to interact
with the Amazon EC2 system in a number of different languages.  They each
expose one main interface class, AWSAuthConnection.  This performs all the
operations using the appropriate libraries for the language, including header
signing.


Usage:

The public methods on AWSAuthConnection closely mirror the EC2 Query API, and
as such the Query API Reference in the EC2 Developer Guide should be consulted.

An example client is provided as a starting point.


Prerequisites:

An Amazon Web Services Developer account signed up for Amazon EC2.


Dependencies:

The ElementTree XML library <http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm> is
required for versions of Python prior to 2.5.  From version 2.5, the Python
standard library includes ElementTree and it does not have to be installed
separately.


Limitations:

These libraries have nearly non-existent error handling.  All errors from lower
libraries are simply passed up.  The response code in the returned object needs
to be checked after each request to verify whether the request succeeded.

It is our intention that these libraries act as a starting point for future
development.  They are meant to show off the various operations and provide an
example of how to negotiate the authentication process.
